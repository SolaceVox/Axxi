## Section 1: Initial Power and Connection Checks

### Step 1: Verify Power Status
**Desktop:**
- [ ] Check if power LED on computer case is lit
- [ ] Ensure power cable is firmly connected to both computer and wall outlet
- [ ] Test wall outlet with another device
- [ ] Try a different power cable if available
- [ ] Check if power supply switch (if present) is in ON position

**Expected Outcome:** Power LED should be solid or blinking, indicating the computer is receiving power.

**Laptop:**
- [ ] Check if power LED is lit when charger is connected
- [ ] Ensure charger is firmly connected to laptop and wall outlet
- [ ] Try a different power outlet
- [ ] Check charger cable for damage or loose connections
- [ ] Remove battery (if removable) and try powering on with charger only

**Expected Outcome:** Charging LED should indicate power is being received.

### Step 2: Check Display Power
**Desktop Monitor:**
- [ ] Verify monitor power cable is connected securely
- [ ] Press monitor power button to ensure it's on
- [ ] Check for power LED on monitor (usually blue/green when on, orange/red in standby)
- [ ] Try a different power cable for the monitor

**Expected Outcome:** Monitor should show power LED and may display "No Signal" message.

**Laptop:**
- [ ] Check if screen backlight is on (look closely in bright light)
- [ ] Try adjusting brightness using function keys (Fn + brightness keys)
- [ ] Look for very dim display that might indicate backlight failure

**Expected Outcome:** Screen should show some level of illumination or respond to brightness adjustments.

## Section 2: Display Connection Verification

### Step 3: Check Video Connections
**Desktop:**
- [ ] Ensure video cable (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, DVI) is securely connected
- [ ] Check both ends of the video cable (computer and monitor)
- [ ] Try a different video cable
- [ ] If multiple video ports available, try a different port
- [ ] Ensure cable is connected to graphics card, not motherboard (if dedicated GPU present)

**Expected Outcome:** Secure connections should eliminate loose cable issues.

**Laptop:**
- [ ] Connect external monitor using HDMI, USB-C, or VGA port
- [ ] Use function keys to switch display output (usually Fn + F4, F5, or F8)
- [ ] Try different display modes: laptop only, external only, duplicate, extend

**Expected Outcome:** External monitor should display if laptop screen is faulty.

### Step 4: Test with Known Good Components
**Desktop:**
- [ ] Try a different monitor if available
- [ ] Test monitor with another computer
- [ ] Try a different video cable
- [ ] If possible, test with different graphics card

**Expected Outcome:** This isolates whether the issue is with the monitor, cable, or computer.

**Laptop:**
- [ ] Connect to external monitor or TV
- [ ] Test laptop with different display cable
- [ ] Try connecting to projector if available

**Expected Outcome:** External display working indicates laptop screen or internal connection issue.

## Section 3: System and Display Settings

### Step 5: Check Display Settings and Boot Process
**Both Desktop and Laptop:**
- [ ] Listen for system beeps during startup (indicates POST process)
- [ ] Check if hard drive activity LED blinks (shows system is booting)
- [ ] Wait 2-3 minutes for complete boot process
- [ ] Try pressing Caps Lock to see if LED responds (indicates system is responsive)

**Expected Outcome:** System sounds and LED activity indicate computer is functioning.

### Step 6: Boot in Safe Mode
**Windows:**
- [ ] Power off computer completely
- [ ] Turn on and immediately press F8 repeatedly (older Windows) or Shift+F8 (Windows 10/11)
- [ ] Select "Safe Mode" from menu
- [ ] Alternatively, force shutdown 3 times to trigger automatic repair

**Expected Outcome:** Safe mode should display with basic graphics drivers.

**Mac:**
- [ ] Hold Shift key immediately after pressing power button
- [ ] Keep holding until Apple logo appears
- [ ] Release Shift key and wait for boot

**Expected Outcome:** Safe boot should work with basic display drivers.

## Section 4: Hardware Component Testing

### Step 7: Memory (RAM) Testing
**Desktop:**
- [ ] Power off and unplug computer
- [ ] Remove side panel
- [ ] Reseat RAM modules (remove and reinstall firmly)
- [ ] Try one RAM stick at a time
- [ ] Try RAM in different slots

**Expected Outcome:** Properly seated RAM should allow normal boot process.

**Laptop:**
- [ ] Check if RAM is accessible (some laptops have removable panels)
- [ ] If accessible, reseat RAM modules
- [ ] Try with one module if multiple are present

**Expected Outcome:** Reseated RAM may resolve boot issues causing blank screen.

### Step 8: Graphics Card Testing (Desktop Only)
- [ ] Power off and unplug computer
- [ ] Remove graphics card
- [ ] Connect monitor to motherboard video output
- [ ] Boot computer
- [ ] If successful, reseat graphics card or try different slot

**Expected Outcome:** Motherboard graphics should provide basic display if GPU is faulty.

### Step 9: CMOS/BIOS Reset
**Desktop:**
- [ ] Power off and unplug computer
- [ ] Locate CMOS battery on motherboard
- [ ] Remove battery for 5-10 minutes
- [ ] Reinstall battery
- [ ] Try booting

**Expected Outcome:** BIOS reset may resolve configuration issues.

**Laptop:**
- [ ] Remove battery and power adapter
- [ ] Hold power button for 30 seconds
- [ ] Reconnect power and try booting
- [ ] Some laptops have CMOS reset button or procedure

**Expected Outcome:** Hardware reset may resolve power or display issues.

## Section 5: Advanced Diagnostics

### Step 10: Check for Hardware Failures
**Signs of Hardware Failure:**
- [ ] No power LEDs at all
- [ ] Unusual noises (clicking, grinding)
- [ ] Burning smell
- [ ] System powers on but no display after trying all above steps
- [ ] Multiple beep codes during startup

**Expected Outcome:** These signs may indicate need for professional repair.

### Step 11: Test Individual Components
**Desktop Component Testing:**
- [ ] Test power supply with multimeter or PSU tester
- [ ] Try different graphics card
- [ ] Test with minimal components (CPU, one RAM stick, graphics)
- [ ] Check motherboard for visible damage (bulging capacitors, burn marks)

**Expected Outcome:** Isolating faulty components helps determine repair needs.

## Section 6: Software-Related Issues

### Step 12: Boot from External Media
- [ ] Create bootable USB drive with Linux live distribution
- [ ] Boot from USB drive
- [ ] Check if display works with different operating system

**Expected Outcome:** Working display with live OS indicates software/driver issue.

### Step 13: Check Recent Changes
- [ ] Recall any recent hardware installations
- [ ] Remember recent software updates or driver installations
- [ ] Consider recent power outages or electrical issues
- [ ] Check if issue started after specific event

**Expected Outcome:** Identifying recent changes helps pinpoint cause.
